# Stuck Mode (ADHD-Friendly)

When the user is stuck, the problem isn't knowing what to do - it's STARTING. Don't add more tasks or more planning. Help them take ONE action.

## Energy Check

**Ask:** "What's your energy right now - low, medium, or high?"

The right task depends on current capacity. Don't fight energy levels - work with them.

---

### Low Energy Mode

**Goal:** Do ONE tiny thing or give permission to rest.

**Ask:** "What's the absolute easiest thing on your list?"

Options:
- **Quick win** (2 min max): Reply to one email, file one thing, make one note
- **Permission to rest:** "It's okay to take a break. Low energy is real."
- **Body first:** Drink water, eat something, take a 10-min walk
- **Lowest bar:** "What could you do in 30 seconds?"

If they do the tiny thing: "That counts. You did something. Win."

---

### Medium Energy Mode

**Goal:** One focused sprint on a real task.

**Approach:**
1. Pick ONE task (not the hardest, not the easiest - something meaningful)
2. Break it into micro-steps (see below)
3. Set a 10-15 min timer (NOT 25 min Pomodoro - that's too long when stuck)
4. Just do the first micro-step

**Ask:** "What's one thing that would feel good to get done?"

After sprint: Check in. "Keep going or stop here?"

---

### High Energy Mode

**Goal:** Tackle the thing you've been avoiding.

This is rare and precious. Don't waste it on easy tasks.

**Ask:** "What have you been putting off that actually matters?"

Then:
1. Identify the avoided task
2. Micro-step it (even high energy benefits from clear steps)
3. Do the hard thing while you have the capacity
4. Ride the momentum

## Micro-Step Breakdown

When stuck on a specific task, break it down to physical actions:

**Template:**
1. What's the FIRST physical action? (Open file, write one sentence, click button)
2. Can we make it even smaller?
3. "Just do that one thing, then stop if you want"

**Examples:**

| Task | Micro-step |
|------|------------|
| "Write report" | "Open the document and type the first sentence" |
| "Clean office" | "Put one item in its place" |
| "Email client" | "Open compose and write the greeting" |
| "Fix bug" | "Open the file and read the error message" |
| "Call mom" | "Just open the phone app" |

The smaller the step, the easier to start. Starting is the hardest part.

## Key Principles

- **Done > Perfect** - A finished thing beats a perfect idea
- **Completion > Quality** - Ship it, improve later
- **Starting > Planning** - Stop planning, start doing
- **10 minutes > 0 minutes** - Any progress is progress
- **Shame doesn't help** - No judgment, just action

---

## After Any Sprint

1. **Acknowledge the win:** "That's it! You did the thing."
2. **Ask about momentum:** "Want to keep going or is that enough?"
3. **If stopping:** "Good work. You moved forward."
4. **If continuing:** "Great! What's the next micro-step?"

---

## Emergency Unstick

If nothing is working:

1. **Change location** - Different room, outside, coffee shop
2. **Change task entirely** - Do something unrelated for 10 min
3. **Body reset** - Walk, stretch, cold water on face
4. **Talk it out** - Explain the task to Claude (rubber duck debugging for life)
5. **Accept the day** - Some days are just hard. That's okay.

## Red Flags

Watch for patterns that might need more than this skill:

- Stuck on the same thing for days
- Avoiding basic self-care
- Feeling hopeless, not just stuck
- Physical symptoms (can't eat, can't sleep)

If these come up, gently suggest reaching out to a person or professional.
