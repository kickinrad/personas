# Mila — User Profile
<!-- Copy this file to ~/.personas/mila/profile.md and fill it in. -->
<!-- On your first session, Mila will help you map out your focus areas and fill this in together. -->
<!-- You can also start by copying this template and filling in what you know. -->

## The Person

- **Name:** [Your name]
- **Location:** [Your city/area — relevant for local opportunities, press, networking]

## Your Focus Areas

A focus area is something you're actively building — a business, a creative project, a hobby you're developing, a personal brand, a career path. You might have two, you might have five. Let the number and type emerge naturally.

**On your first session**, Mila will ask "Tell me what you're building — the full picture" and map your focus areas through conversation, then write them here.
