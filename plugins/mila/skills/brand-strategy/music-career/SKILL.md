# Music Career — Your Creative Project

Strategic development of your music project.

## Before Starting

Read `~/.personas/mila/profile.md` for your music project details (name, genre, releases, collaborators, handles, streaming status).

Query memory for relevant past context:
```
[built-in memory: search "music strategy", "music career", "TikTok music"]
```

## Your Music Project — Current Status

Use profile.md to populate context for this session:
- Project name and genre
- Current releases (platform, date, status)
- Key collaborators
- Distribution status (streaming platforms vs. Bandcamp/SoundCloud only)
- Social handles (dedicated music account, personal account)
- TikTok status

## Agenda — Pick the Focus

Ask which area to dive into:

1. **Release strategy** — what's next?
2. **Streaming distribution** — getting on Spotify, Apple Music, etc.
3. **TikTok launch** — building the first content batch
4. **Instagram growth** — growing the music account
5. **Collaborations** — expanding your network
6. **Genre positioning** — how to describe and market this sound

## 1. Release Strategy

Key question: What's the next release plan?

Framework for growing from early releases:
- **EP (3-5 tracks):** More credibility than singles, easier to playlist, gives press something to cover
- **Single cadence:** Monthly or bi-monthly singles build algorithmic momentum on streaming
- **Album:** Too early for most projects — build catalog and audience first

Questions:
- Any tracks in progress or recorded?
- Are current collaborators involved in future work?
- Is there a target release date or is it open?
- What's the production bottleneck — time, gear, collaboration?

## 2. Streaming Distribution

**Priority action:** Get existing releases on Spotify/Apple Music/Amazon Music if not already there.

This is often low-hanging fruit. Bandcamp is great for credibility but streaming is where discovery happens.

### Distributor Options (research current pricing/features)
```
WebSearch("best music distributor independent artist [current year] DistroKid TuneCore")
```

Common options:
- **DistroKid** (~$22/year, unlimited releases, keeps 100% royalties)
- **TuneCore** (per-release pricing, good for niche/jazz genres)
- **CD Baby** (one-time fee, 9% commission, good for long-tail)
- **Amuse** (free tier available)

**Recommendation (to verify):** DistroKid for its simplicity and speed.

### After Distribution Setup
- Claim Spotify for Artists profile
- Claim Apple Music for Artists profile
- Pitch to Spotify editorial playlists (use profile.md genre tags)
  - Research: `WebSearch("Spotify playlist pitching independent artist [your genre] [current year]")`
- Submit to genre-specific blogs and playlist curators

## 3. TikTok Launch Strategy

TikTok is a major music discovery platform. Niche genres are often underrepresented — early mover advantage.

### Pre-Launch Checklist
- [ ] Claim handle — check availability (dedicated music handle or personal)
- [ ] Create 3-5 videos BEFORE posting (content buffer)
- [ ] Set up profile with bio, links to streaming/Bandcamp

### Content Angles for Music TikTok
1. **The "what is this genre" hook** — "this is what [genre] sounds like when raised on [influence]"
2. **Behind the scenes studio** — recording sessions, instrument work, production process
3. **Making of [your track]** — how the track came together
4. **Instrument showcase** — let the sound speak (no words needed for 15 sec clips)
5. **Collab clips** — collaborators playing over your beat, live-ish feel
6. **Trend participation** — use your tracks as background for trends (gets music exposure)

Research: `WebSearch("[your genre] TikTok creators strategy [current year]")`
Research: `WebSearch("music TikTok how to grow [current year]")`

### Posting Cadence
- Start: 3-5x/week until the algorithm catches on
- Consistency > perfection for TikTok

## 4. Instagram Growth

Content strategy for music Instagram:
- Reels over static posts (algorithm reality)
- Audio: Use your tracks as Reel audio — builds streaming exposure
- Behind the scenes: studio, collaborator sessions, local scene
- Community: engage with your local music scene and genre-adjacent creators

Cross-promotion opportunities:
- Collaborators with their own following = collab content ready to go
- Tag and cross-post with permission — builds both audiences

---

## 5. Collaboration Strategy

Review current collaborators (from profile.md).

Expanding the network:
- **Local scene:** Music schools, venues, jazz/hip-hop communities in your city
- **Online collaborators:** Other producers in the online community for your genre
- **Vocalists/instrumentalists:** The genre may open naturally to vocal features or new instruments
- **Press:** Local music coverage — pitch your project for a feature

Research: `WebSearch("[your city] [your genre] musicians [current year]")`
Research: `WebSearch("[your genre] artists collabs [current year]")`

## 6. Genre Positioning

How to describe your project in a way that's discoverable and memorable:

Questions to refine:
- What artists would your listeners also follow? (Name 3-5 comps — use profile.md if already mapped)
- What's the local angle — is location identity a strength to lean into?
- Does your project name signal something? What does it suggest?

Research: `WebSearch("[your genre] artists [current year] like [your comps]")`

## Tips

- A distinctive genre niche is a strength — lean into the specificity, not just the broad genre
- Distribution to streaming platforms is often the #1 unblocked action item — 30-minute setup with huge upside
- TikTok music discovery is real — artists in niche genres have broken through on 1-3 videos
- Collaborators with their own audiences are among the fastest growth levers
