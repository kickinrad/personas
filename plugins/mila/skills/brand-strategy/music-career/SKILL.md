# Music Career — Wavytone Orchestra

Strategic development of Wavytone Orchestra as an experimental jazz/hip-hop project.

## Before Starting

```
mcp__openmemory__openmemory_query("Wavytone strategy")
mcp__openmemory__openmemory_query("music career")
mcp__openmemory__openmemory_query("TikTok music")
```

## Where Wavytone Is Now

- **Genre:** Experimental jazz/hip-hop fusion with UK grime influences (distinctive niche — not many doing this exactly)
- **Releases:** One single — "skepta bounce" (Bandcamp, June 2024, $1 USD, 3:12)
- **Credits:** Wils Tierney (production/instrumentation), Chet Frierson (saxophone)
- **Distribution:** Bandcamp only — NOT on Spotify, Apple Music, SoundCloud, YouTube
- **Instagram:** @wavytone (dedicated) + @wilsxt (personal, linked)
- **TikTok:** Not started
- **Press:** None

## Agenda — Pick the Focus

Ask Wils which area to dive into:

1. **Release strategy** — what's next after "skepta bounce"?
2. **Streaming distribution** — getting on Spotify, Apple Music, etc.
3. **TikTok launch** — building the first content batch
4. **Instagram growth** — growing @wavytone / @wilsxt for music
5. **Collaborations** — expanding beyond Chet, Richmond scene opportunities
6. **Genre positioning** — how to describe and market this sound

---

## 1. Release Strategy

Key question: What's the next release plan?

Framework for growing from one single:
- **EP (3-5 tracks):** More credibility than singles, easier to playlist, gives press something to cover
- **Single cadence:** Monthly or bi-monthly singles build algorithmic momentum on streaming
- **Album:** Too early — build catalog and audience first

Questions:
- Any tracks in progress or recorded?
- Is Chet Frierson involved in future work?
- Is there a target release date or is it open?
- What's the production bottleneck — time, gear, collaboration?

## 2. Streaming Distribution

**Priority action:** Get "skepta bounce" on Spotify/Apple Music/Amazon Music NOW.

This is low-hanging fruit. Bandcamp is great for credibility but streaming is where discovery happens.

### Distributor Options (research current pricing/features)
```
WebSearch("best music distributor independent artist 2025 DistroKid TuneCore")
```

Common options:
- **DistroKid** (~$22/year, unlimited releases, keeps 100% royalties)
- **TuneCore** (per-release pricing, good for jazz/niche)
- **CD Baby** (one-time fee, 9% commission, good for long-tail)
- **Amuse** (free tier available)

**Recommendation (to verify):** DistroKid for its simplicity and speed.

### After Distribution Setup
- Claim Spotify for Artists profile
- Claim Apple Music for Artists profile
- Pitch "skepta bounce" to Spotify editorial playlists (jazz, hip-hop fusion, experimental)
  - Research: `WebSearch("Spotify playlist pitching independent artist jazz hip hop 2025")`
- Submit to jazz/hip-hop blogs and playlist curators

---

## 3. TikTok Launch Strategy

TikTok is a major music discovery platform. The niche (jazz/hip-hop fusion) is underrepresented — early mover advantage.

### Pre-Launch Checklist
- [ ] Claim handle (@wavytone or @wavytoneorchestra) — check availability
- [ ] Create 3-5 videos BEFORE posting (content buffer)
- [ ] Set up profile with bio, links to Bandcamp/streaming

### Content Angles for Wavytone TikTok
1. **The "what is this genre" hook** — "this is what jazz sounds like when raised on grime"
2. **Behind the scenes studio** — saxophone recording sessions with Chet
3. **"skepta bounce" making of** — how the track came together
4. **Instrument showcase** — let the sound speak (no words needed for 15 sec clips)
5. **Collab clips** — Chet playing over the beat, live-ish feel
6. **Trend participation** — use Wavytone tracks as background for trends (gets music exposure)

### Posting Cadence
- Start: 3-5x/week until the algorithm catches on
- Consistency > perfection for TikTok

## 4. Instagram Growth (@wavytone)

Current state: exists, linked to @wilsxt, but unclear activity level.

Content strategy for music Instagram:
- Reels over static posts (algorithm reality)
- Audio: Use Wavytone tracks as Reel audio — builds streaming exposure
- Behind the scenes: studio, Chet collaborations, Richmond jazz scene
- Community: engage with Richmond music scene, jazz/hip-hop fusion creators

Cross-promotion opportunities:
- Chet Frierson has Richmond scene credibility — cross-tag on collab content
- Weekend Plans (Chet's main band) has Richmond fanbase — potential audience overlap

---

## 5. Collaboration Strategy

Current collaborators: Chet Frierson (sax, Weekend Plans, Richmond jazz scene)

Expanding the network:
- **Richmond scene:** VCU jazz department (students/alums), RVA music venues, Richmond Jazz Society
- **Online collaborators:** Other jazz/hip-hop producers in the online jazz community
- **Vocalists:** The genre opens naturally to vocal features (jazz vocals, rap, spoken word)
- **Press:** Style Weekly RVA music coverage — pitch Wavytone for a feature (Chet was featured)

## 6. Genre Positioning

How to describe Wavytone in a way that's discoverable and memorable:

Working description: "Experimental jazz/hip-hop fusion from Richmond, VA — where saxophone meets grime"

Questions to refine:
- What artists would Wavytone listeners also follow? (Kendrick + jazz? Thundercat? BadBadNotGood? Kamasi Washington?)
- What's the Richmond angle — is local identity a strength to lean into?
- Does "orchestra" in the name signal something? (scale? ambition? classical crossover?)

```

## Tips

- The genre niche is genuinely distinctive — lean into the specificity, not "jazz" alone
- Distribution is the #1 unblocked action item — it's a 30-minute setup with huge upside
- Chet Frierson is an asset — the Richmond scene credibility + his own following = collab content ready to go
- TikTok music discovery is real — artists in similar niches have blown up on 1-3 videos
