# Content Planning

Build a content calendar that's realistic to execute and actually aligned with goals — not generic, not busywork.

## Before Starting

Read `~/.personas/mila/profile.md` for handles, platforms, and focus areas.

Pull context from memory:
```
[built-in memory: search "content strategy", "platform performance"]
mcp__google_workspace__get_events (next 2-4 weeks)
```

Check: Are there upcoming releases, milestones, or deadlines that anchor the calendar?

## Clarify Scope

Ask: "Are we planning for this week, this month, or building a repeatable framework?"

- **Week:** Quick batch — 5-7 posts across platforms
- **Month:** Full calendar with themes and campaigns
- **Framework:** Repeatable posting cadence they can run on autopilot

## Platform-Specific Strategy

Use profile.md to populate the actual handles and focus areas below.

### 📸 Instagram

**Music / Creative Project account** (handle from profile.md)
- Content: clips, studio moments, process videos, collab content
- Format mix: Reels > Carousels > Static (algorithm reality)
- Cadence: 3-4x/week (Reels perform on Tues/Wed/Fri historically)
- Research current audio trends: `WebSearch("instagram reels trending sounds [current month year]")`

**Agency / Business account** (handle from profile.md)
- Before/afters, client wins (with permission), process glimpses, local angle
- Format: Carousels for portfolio, Reels for personality/behind-scenes
- Cadence: 2-3x/week

**Personal account** (handle from profile.md)
- The "person behind the brands" — bridges all focus areas
- Avoid splitting personality artificially; you are one person

### 🎵 TikTok (Creative Project)
- If not started yet — early mover advantage in niche genres
- Launch strategy: 3-5 videos before "going live" (content buffer)
- Format: 15-30 sec clips win discovery; full tracks as stitchable hooks
- Research: `WebSearch("[your genre/niche] TikTok creators [current year]")`
- Check profile.md for handle to claim or current status

### 💼 LinkedIn (Business + Personal Brand)
- Business thought leadership: tips from your specialty, client process insights, community
- Personal: developer/creative perspective on tools, AI, creative process
- Format: Text-heavy posts perform (no images needed); occasional carousels
- Cadence: 2-3x/week, consistent more important than volume
- DO NOT: pure promotional posts ("hire me") — educate and add value instead
- Research: `WebSearch("LinkedIn content strategy B2B [your specialty] [current year]")`

### ✍️ Writing (Blog/Substack/Medium)
- Long-form: 1 piece per month minimum to start (sustainable)
- Topics: your unique perspective across all focus areas
- Cross-post strategy: Write once → Substack (owned list) + Medium (discovery) + LinkedIn excerpt
- Research worth doing: `WebSearch("Substack vs Medium [current year] writer strategy")`

## Building the Calendar

### Weekly Content Framework (sustainable cadence)

| Day | Platform | Focus Area | Format |
|-----|----------|------------|--------|
| Mon | LinkedIn | Business/Personal | Text post |
| Tue | Instagram [creative handle] | Creative Project | Reel |
| Wed | LinkedIn | Business/Personal | Text post |
| Thu | Instagram [business handle] | Business | Carousel or Reel |
| Fri | Instagram [creative handle] | Creative Project | Reel |
| Sat | TikTok | Creative Project | Short clip |
| (Monthly) | Substack/Medium | Personal | Long-form |

Adjust based on actual capacity. A sustainable 3x/week beats an unsustainable 7x/week.

## Content Ideation

For each upcoming piece, define:
1. **Platform + Handle** (from profile.md)
2. **Focus Area** (Business / Creative / Personal)
3. **Topic/Hook**
4. **Format** (Reel, carousel, text, etc.)
5. **Call to action** (if any)
6. **Publish date**

### Content Idea Generation

For creative project content:
- Behind the scenes: recording/production process
- Genre education: "what is [your genre]?" (searchable, educational)
- Collaborator content (cross-posting potential)
- Local scene angle ("sounds from [your city]")
- Covers or interpretations in your style

For business content:
- Client transformation (before/after — get permission)
- "How we build [product/service] that clients can actually use"
- Local business spotlight
- Tips: "3 things your [product/service] needs before [common mistake]"

For personal brand content:
- "What it's like to [run a business] AND [make creative work]"
- Tools or methods you're building/using
- Creative process posts

## Store + Schedule

Store insights to memory:
```
[built-in memory: save "Content calendar [date]: [summary of plan]"]
[built-in memory: save "[Any platform insight discovered during planning]"]
```

Add content drops to calendar:
```
mcp__google_workspace__create_event(title="Post: [topic]", date=[date])
```

## Output

Deliver a clean calendar in this format:

```
📅 Content Calendar — Week of [date]

Mon: [Platform] | [Topic] | [Format]
Tue: [Platform] | [Topic] | [Format]
...

📝 Notes:
- [Any strategy insight]
- [Platform-specific tip]

🎯 Goal for this week: [One measurable outcome]
```

## Tips

- Start with what you already have (existing content, recordings) before creating new assets
- If there's zero content ready, the first step is a content batch session, not a calendar
- Content creation ≠ strategy. Showing up consistently matters more than perfection
- Research trending sounds/formats before finalizing Reel/TikTok ideas
