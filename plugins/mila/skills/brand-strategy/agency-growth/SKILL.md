# Agency Growth — b.f.f.

Strategic deep-dive on growing the b.f.f. digital design agency.

## Before Starting

```
mcp__openmemory__openmemory_query("agency strategy")
mcp__openmemory__openmemory_query("bff clients")
mcp__openmemory__openmemory_query("LinkedIn strategy")
```

## What We Know About b.f.f.

- **What they do:** Custom WordPress design, branding, online advertising (GA/Pixel, Mailchimp, WooCommerce, Stripe)
- **Market:** Richmond, VA base + remote clients worldwide
- **Positioning:** Boutique, no-template, custom work — "trusted best friend" energy
- **Current clients:** Healthcare, nonprofits, architecture, media (PBS Richmond, Virginia Association of Health Plans, etc.)
- **Differentiator:** Non-templated, built for client self-management. Personal service.

## Agenda — Pick the Focus

Ask Wils which area to dive into:

1. **Client pipeline** — who's in the funnel, what needs follow-up
2. **LinkedIn strategy** — building the agency's professional presence
3. **Portfolio + positioning** — updating the site, clarifying messaging
4. **Service evolution** — adding/removing/repricing services
5. **Growth strategy** — where are the next clients coming from?

## 1. Client Pipeline Review

Walk through the current pipeline:
- **Active clients:** What are they working on? Any at risk?
- **Prospective leads:** Who's been contacted but hasn't converted?
- **Referral opportunities:** Who could refer new clients?
- **Lapsed clients:** Who has worked with b.f.f. before and might need new work?

Key question: "Is the pipeline full, thin, or empty right now?"

If thin: What's one action this week to generate a lead?
- Reach out to a past client
- Post a portfolio piece on LinkedIn
- Ask a current client for a referral
- Pitch a local Richmond organization you admire

Action items → Google Tasks:
```
mcp__google_workspace__create_task(title="Follow up: [client name]", due_date)
```

## 2. LinkedIn Strategy

LinkedIn is the highest-ROI platform for b.f.f. and is currently underdeveloped.

**Current state:** Profile exists ("UX + WordPress Designer") but low activity and no strategic content.

**Goal:** Establish Wils as the go-to Richmond-area (and remote) expert for boutique WordPress design + digital marketing for nonprofits and healthcare orgs.

### Profile Optimization Checklist
- [ ] Headline: More specific than "UX + WordPress Designer" — e.g., "WordPress Design for Nonprofits & Healthcare | b.f.f. | Richmond, VA"
- [ ] About section: Tell the b.f.f. story, who you help, why
- [ ] Featured section: Link to bestfootforward.business, showcase 2-3 client results
- [ ] Experience: bff.llc properly listed with description
- [ ] Portfolio link: Add in contact info

### Content Strategy (2-3x/week)

Content pillars for LinkedIn:
1. **Client wins** — anonymized results ("Helped a Richmond nonprofit 3x their donation conversions")
2. **Process insights** — "Why we never use templates" / "What happens in a WordPress handoff"
3. **Education** — "Before running Facebook ads, fix your website first"
4. **Local Richmond angle** — RVA business community, nonprofit spotlight
5. **Wils the person** — authenticity builds trust ("running an agency AND a jazz band")

Avoid: self-promotional posts with no value, irregular bursts.

## 3. Portfolio + Positioning

Review bestfootforward.business:
- Is the portfolio current? Any recent clients missing?
- Does the homepage clearly communicate who you serve and what you do?
- Is there a clear call to action?

Positioning question: "Who is b.f.f.'s ideal client in 2025?"
- By sector: healthcare, nonprofits, architecture, media — is this still right?
- By size: small local businesses? regional orgs? national nonprofits?
- By need: fresh build, redesign, ongoing maintenance, + ads?

## 4. Service Evolution

Walk through the current service offering:
- Custom WordPress design ✓
- Online advertising setup ✓
- Integrations (Google Suite, Mailchimp, WooCommerce, Stripe) ✓
- Branding + logo design ✓

Questions to explore:
- Is there a service that's not profitable to offer at the current price?
- Is there a service clients keep asking for that b.f.f. doesn't offer?
- Could an ongoing retainer (maintenance + ads management) create recurring revenue?
- Is there a higher-ticket "strategic" tier above execution work?

---

## 5. Growth Strategy

Where are the next clients coming from?

**Channel analysis:**
- Referrals (historically most reliable for boutique agencies)
- LinkedIn (currently underutilized — high potential)
- Instagram @bff.llc (brand awareness, local RVA)
- Local networking (Richmond business community, nonprofits, BNI-type groups)
- Cold outreach (targeted, research-backed)

For each channel: Is it active? What's the barrier to using it better?

**Research:**

WebSearch("nonprofit web design market Richmond VA")

## Store Insights

```
mcp__openmemory__openmemory_store("Agency session [date]: [key decisions/insights]")
mcp__openmemory__openmemory_store("[Any specific strategy insight about clients, LinkedIn, or positioning]")
```

## Tips

- b.f.f.'s strongest growth lever is probably LinkedIn — it's completely untapped
- The nonprofit/healthcare niche is defensible and underserved by boutique shops
- Recurring revenue (maintenance retainers) would stabilize the business significantly
- Personal brand (Wils) and agency brand (b.f.f.) reinforce each other on LinkedIn
