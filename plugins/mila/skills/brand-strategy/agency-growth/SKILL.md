# Agency Growth

Strategic deep-dive on growing your digital agency or service business.

## Before Starting

Read `~/.personas/mila/profile.md` for your agency details (name, positioning, client sectors, current clients, handles).

Query memory for relevant past context:
```
[built-in memory: search "agency strategy", "client pipeline", "LinkedIn strategy"]
```

## About Your Agency

Use profile.md to populate context for this session:
- Agency name and positioning
- Current client sectors and any named clients
- Primary service offerings
- Key differentiators
- Geographic market (local + remote, or remote-only)
- LinkedIn and website URLs

## Agenda — Pick the Focus

Ask which area to dive into:

1. **Client pipeline** — who's in the funnel, what needs follow-up
2. **LinkedIn strategy** — building the agency's professional presence
3. **Portfolio + positioning** — updating the site, clarifying messaging
4. **Service evolution** — adding/removing/repricing services
5. **Growth strategy** — where are the next clients coming from?

## 1. Client Pipeline Review

Walk through the current pipeline:
- **Active clients:** What are they working on? Any at risk?
- **Prospective leads:** Who's been contacted but hasn't converted?
- **Referral opportunities:** Who could refer new clients?
- **Lapsed clients:** Who has worked with you before and might need new work?

Key question: "Is the pipeline full, thin, or empty right now?"

If thin: What's one action this week to generate a lead?
- Reach out to a past client
- Post a portfolio piece on LinkedIn
- Ask a current client for a referral
- Pitch a local or niche organization you admire

Action items → Google Tasks:
```
mcp__google_workspace__create_task(title="Follow up: [client name]", due_date)
```

## 2. LinkedIn Strategy

LinkedIn is often the highest-ROI platform for boutique agencies and is commonly underdeveloped.

**Goal:** Establish the user as the go-to expert in their niche (use profile.md for specialty and target market).

### Profile Optimization Checklist
- [ ] Headline: More specific than just a job title — e.g., "[Your specialty] | [Agency name] | [Location or Remote]"
- [ ] About section: Tell the agency story, who you help, why
- [ ] Featured section: Link to agency site, showcase 2-3 client results
- [ ] Experience: Agency properly listed with description
- [ ] Portfolio link: Add in contact info

### Content Strategy (2-3x/week)

Content pillars for LinkedIn:
1. **Client wins** — anonymized results ("Helped a [sector] client 3x their [metric]")
2. **Process insights** — "Why we never use templates" / "What a real client handoff looks like"
3. **Education** — "Before running ads, fix your website first"
4. **Niche angle** — your client sectors, community spotlight
5. **You as a person** — authenticity builds trust ("running an agency AND [your creative work]")

Avoid: self-promotional posts with no value, irregular bursts.

Research: `WebSearch("LinkedIn content strategy [your specialty] agency [current year]")`

## 3. Portfolio + Positioning

Review your agency website:
- Is the portfolio current? Any recent clients missing?
- Does the homepage clearly communicate who you serve and what you do?
- Is there a clear call to action?

Positioning question: "Who is your ideal client right now?"
- By sector: Is your current niche still right? (use profile.md for current sectors)
- By size: Small local businesses? Regional orgs? National clients?
- By need: Fresh build, redesign, ongoing maintenance, ads management?

Research competitors: `WebSearch("boutique [your specialty] agency [your market]")`

---

## 4. Service Evolution

Walk through the current service offering (read from profile.md):

Questions to explore:
- Is there a service that's not profitable to offer at the current price?
- Is there a service clients keep asking for that you don't offer?
- Could an ongoing retainer (maintenance + management) create recurring revenue?
- Is there a higher-ticket "strategic" tier above execution work?

---

## 5. Growth Strategy

Where are the next clients coming from?

**Channel analysis:**
- Referrals (historically most reliable for boutique agencies)
- LinkedIn (often underutilized — high potential)
- Instagram/agency handle (brand awareness, local community)
- Local networking (business community, sector-specific groups)
- Cold outreach (targeted, research-backed)

For each channel: Is it active? What's the barrier to using it better?

**Research:**
```
WebSearch("how to get clients [your specialty] agency [current year]")
WebSearch("[your client sector] web design market [your city or remote]")
```

## Store Insights

```
[built-in memory: save "Agency session [date]: [key decisions/insights]"]
[built-in memory: save "[Any specific strategy insight about clients, LinkedIn, or positioning]"]
```

## Tips

- LinkedIn is commonly the most untapped growth lever for boutique agencies
- A niche client sector (e.g., nonprofits, healthcare, architecture) is defensible and underserved by generic shops
- Recurring revenue (maintenance retainers) stabilizes income significantly
- Personal brand and agency brand reinforce each other on LinkedIn
